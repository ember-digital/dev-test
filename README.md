## Instructions

This repository contains a set of exercises that you can use to exhibit your skills, abilities and thought processes.

If you have any questions please feel free to email tech@ember.co. Or feel free to get back in touch with whoever you've been speaking with so far during the recruitment process.

Let's dive in...

1. Create a new **private** Github repo for your exercise and add [Drew @ Ember](https://github.com/Andrewryanhyde) and [ Roman @ Ember](https://github.com/RomanShabanov) as collaborators.

2. Complete as much of the exercise as you can _**in 4 hours or less.**_ Please do not spend longer than this - we want to be fair and so don't expect to eat into people's personal lives more than we have to in order to fairly assess each candidate!

3. Be sure to include a `README.md` - suggested contents:
    * A short explanation of what you've built
    * How to test/demo/run (if applicable)
    * Any feedback - how are these docs? Could we improve them or the process generally?
    * Future work - anything you would have liked to include if you'd had more time.

4. From here you can pick an exercise - whichever you prefer:
    * [Exercise 1: Visualising Compensation and Benefits](exercise1/README.md)
    * [Exercise 2: Upload, Store and Display Data](exercise2/README.md)

5. When complete, email a link to the repo and any additional instructions (which are not in the README.md) to salla@ember.co.

6. We'll review your submission and get back to you within 3 business days.

Good luck!
